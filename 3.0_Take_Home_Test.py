HONOR CODE: I solemnly promise that while taking this test I will only use PyCharm or the Internet,
but I will definitely not ask another person except the instructor. Signed: ______________________



1. Write a line of code that will print your name.
'''


'''
2. How do you enter a comment in a program?

'''


'''
3. What is the ouput of the following lines of code?
print (2/3)
print (2//3)
'''


'''
4. Write a line of code that creates a variable called pi and sets it to an
appropriate value.

'''


'''
5. Why does this code not work?
A=22
print(a)
'''



'''
6. All of the variable names below can be used. But which of these is the best?
a
A
Area
AREA
area
areaOfRectangle
AreaOfRectangle
'''


'''
7. Which of these variables names are not allowed in Python?
apple
Apple
APPLE
Apple2
1Apple
account number
account_number
account.number
accountNumber
account#
'''



'''
8. Why does this code not work?

print(a)
a=45
'''



'''
9. Write a line of code that will ask the user for the length of a square's
side and store the result in a variable. Make sure to convert the value
to an integer.
'''


'''
10. Write a line of code that prints the area of the square, using the
number the user typed in that you stored in question 9.
'''



'''11. Do the same as in questions 9 and 10, but with the formula for the
area of an ellipse. Area=pi*a*b where a and b are the lengths of the major radii.
'''



'''
12. Do the same as in questions 9 and 10, but with a formula to find
the pressure of a gas. PV=nRT where n is the number of moles, T is the absolute temperature, V is the
volume, and R is the gas constant 8.3144.
'''


'''
13. Explain the mistake in this code:

pi = float(3.14)
'''



'''
14. Assume radius has been defined. This code runs, but isn't very good. Explain the mistake in the following code:

x=3.14
pi=x
area=pi*radius**2
'''


'''
Assuming x and y are already defined, this code runs. But
something isn't quite right. Explain the mistake in the following code:

a=((x)*(y))
'''


'''
16. Explain the mistake in the following code:

radius = input(float("Enter the radius:"))
'''
